# MyBike

This fitness app's main purpose is to help bike owners keep track of their bikes' maintenance
intervals and make sure they're in good condition. The app has three sections: Bikes, Rides and
Settings. Owners of bicycles will be able to:
Define multiple bikes and customize them based on type, color, and other characteristics.
Record rides for each individual bike and view total rides statistics.
Receive alerts before a service interval is due based on user settings.

The application was developed for the Garmin mobile contest based on the received requirements.
